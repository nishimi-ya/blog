An American psychologist, B.F. Skinner (1904-1990), became famous for his
invention, the “Skinner Box,” which he used to study behavioral
conditioning in animals. In his experiments, Skinner placed rats inside
a box equipped with mechanisms such as lights and levers. He programmed
the box so that when a rat stood on a lever or pressed it at a certain
time, the rat would receive either a reward in the form of a food pellet
or, in other cases, a mild electric shock. The main purpose of these
experiments was to understand behavior patterns, with implications for
human behavior.

Skinner wrote a book titled *Beyond Freedom and Dignity*, where he
detailed his worldview. His vision was to create a "behavioral utopia" in
which all human actions are conditioned responses to certain stimuli,
similar to the Skinner Box. For example, humans might do socially
acceptable things to receive positive reinforcement and, conversely, would
be punished if they violated norms.

According to Skinner, concepts like freedom and dignity are mere
abstractions; they are metaphysical and not essential to social progress.
He argued that “social engineers” could design a society that shapes
people to behave as expected. This thought is relevant to us today
because, consciously or not, we live in a world that resembles
a modern-day “Skinner Box”—social media.

## Social Media as a Means of Social Control

Social media is essentially a tool for social control. Every major
platform—whether Facebook, Twitter, or Reddit—can be viewed as a giant
“Skinner Box.” Initially, when these platforms were created, they offered
an open, decentralized space where users could freely share almost
anything. However, over time, the administrators of these platforms
realized that they could play the role of social engineers, guiding user
behavior.

On social media, controlling behavior actually requires minimal effort.
The system tends to be self-regulating, and platforms can even make users
influence each other in ways that reinforce desired behaviors. At a basic
level, for instance, there is the feature of “banning” users. Not everyone
has to be banned, just enough to create a chilling effect, causing others
to avoid engaging in undesirable behavior.

The biggest privacy issue is not about the exposure of personal
information but rather about the behavior data collected as metadata.
Although those who collect this data might not know your specific
identity, this metadata is still used to train artificial intelligence
(AI), which can then be applied to influence cognition. With this data,
platforms can find new ways to spread messages or trigger specific
hashtags, or provide recommendations that direct our interactions.

## The Impact on Focus and Deep Thinking

With all the information available at our fingertips, it has become
increasingly difficult to “single-task” or focus solely on one activity.
Tasks that require attention and deep contemplation are often disrupted by
the urge to stay “connected.” A student, for example, might ask a friend
to hide their phone or deactivate their Facebook account to concentrate on
completing an assignment.

Sharing on social media has become the norm, and this is not inherently
wrong. However, the problem is that the content shared tends to be shallow
and distracts from more substantial, meaningful thought.

As social media and technology become more pervasive in society,
especially among younger generations, this issue will only grow. Social
norms that were once strict now become more relaxed, while the drive for
contemplative thinking fades into the background.

## A Technological Revolution Unlike Social Revolutions of the Past

While society often sees social media as a new tool for social change,
those with deeper insight may understand that this technological
revolution is not like past social revolutions. Personally, I enjoy social
media for its ability to connect us with others quickly and easily, which
fulfills the human need for companionship and understanding.

However, we must ask ourselves: How can the time we spend on social media
translate into real-life impact? Why is this information available to me?
What is the purpose of this image, story, or tweet that I come across?

Rather than merely using social media as an answer to every question that
arises in daily interactions, it would be beneficial to treat it as a tool
for reflecting on larger issues. Don’t let social media bury you under
this newfound wealth of information without purpose. Critically question
everything you see and don’t settle for limited knowledge; strive to
explore the deeper meaning behind the surface-level interactions.
